# Pleasurable-Portfolio-Project

## Description:

This project represents an assignment where I was tasked with creating a web application from scratch to build my own portfolio page, which I will be able to add to as my UNCC Coding Bootcamp course progresses.  In addition, this is an excellent opportunity to showcase the skills and talents to employers looking for up-and-coming developers such as myself. This portfolio project aims to highlight my strongest work as well as demonstrate my thought process in building it from the ground-up.  In particular, I used HTML and CSS in this porject to practice the new skills with these technologies that I have been developing in the first week of UNCC's Coding Bootcamp.
